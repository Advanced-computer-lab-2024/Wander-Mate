<h1 align="center"># Wander Mate: Travel Planning Made Easy</h1>

<h4 align="center">A modern, intuitive travel planning and itinerary management tool to help users explore the world effortlessly.</h4>

## Motivation

The goal of Wander-Mate is to make travel planning more convenient and enjoyable by offering a comprehensive platform where users can book everything they need for their vacation in one place. Whether itâ€™s flights, hotels, activities, transportation, itinerary planning, or even products to buy, our platform streamlines the entire process, eliminating the need to search across multiple sites.

By simplifying and centralizing travel arrangements, we hope to reduce the stress and complexity often associated with planning trips. Our aim is to make the experience of traveling not only easier but also more exciting. We believe that by providing travelers with a seamless and hassle-free booking process, we can inspire more people to explore new destinations and embark on memorable journeys with confidence.

## Code Style

Our project follows a modular and structured code style to ensure maintainability and scalability. The backend is designed to support various user roles, including tourists, tour guides, sellers, advertisers, tourism governors, and admins, each with their own set of methods for interacting with the platform. Each user role is represented by a dedicated model, which encapsulates the relevant data and functionality specific to that role.

Additionally, we have multiple models to represent key entities within the platform, such as products, orders, bookings, and more. These models are used to manage and interact with the data efficiently.

The frontend is built using **React**, and it communicates seamlessly with the backend via API endpoints. This enables users to access and interact with the platform's features in real-time, whether it's booking a flight, managing an itinerary, or processing an order.

### Key Code Style Guidelines:

- **Consistency**:  
  We use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and models to make the code easy to read and understand.

- **Modular Structure**:  
  The project is divided into clear modules for both the backend and frontend, following the single responsibility principle.

- **CamelCase Naming**:  
  For variables and functions, we use `camelCase` to maintain consistency with JavaScript conventions.

- **Model Representation**:  
  Each entity in the application, whether a user role or a core feature like products and bookings, is represented by its own model.

- **React Best Practices**:  
  The frontend is built with React, using functional components, hooks, and a state management system (e.g., Context API or Redux) to ensure maintainable and reusable code.

- **API Integration**:  
  All frontend components interact with the backend through API calls, adhering to RESTful conventions and ensuring a smooth user experience.

This structured approach ensures that the codebase remains clean, efficient, and easy to extend as new features are added.
