## Motivation

The goal of Wander-Mate is to make travel planning more convenient and enjoyable by offering a comprehensive platform where users can book everything they need for their vacation in one place. Whether itâ€™s flights, hotels, activities, transportation, itinerary planning, or even products to buy, our platform streamlines the entire process, eliminating the need to search across multiple sites.

By simplifying and centralizing travel arrangements, we hope to reduce the stress and complexity often associated with planning trips. Our aim is to make the experience of traveling not only easier but also more exciting. We believe that by providing travelers with a seamless and hassle-free booking process, we can inspire more people to explore new destinations and embark on memorable journeys with confidence.

## Known Issues

## Code Style

Our project follows a modular and structured code style to ensure maintainability and scalability. The backend is designed to support various user roles, including tourists, tour guides, sellers, advertisers, tourism governors, and admins, each with their own set of methods for interacting with the platform. Each user role is represented by a dedicated model, which encapsulates the relevant data and functionality specific to that role.

Additionally, we have multiple models to represent key entities within the platform, such as products, orders, bookings, and more. These models are used to manage and interact with the data efficiently.

The frontend is built using **React**, and it communicates seamlessly with the backend via API endpoints. This enables users to access and interact with the platform's features in real-time, whether it's booking a flight, managing an itinerary, or processing an order.

### Key Code Style Guidelines:

- **Consistency**:  
  We use consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and models to make the code easy to read and understand.

- **Modular Structure**:  
  The project is divided into clear modules for both the backend and frontend, following the single responsibility principle.

- **CamelCase Naming**:  
  For variables and functions, we use `camelCase` to maintain consistency with JavaScript conventions.

- **Model Representation**:  
  Each entity in the application, whether a user role or a core feature like products and bookings, is represented by its own model.

- **React Best Practices**:  
  The frontend is built with React, using functional components, hooks, and a state management system (e.g., Context API or Redux) to ensure maintainable and reusable code.

- **API Integration**:  
  All frontend components interact with the backend through API calls, adhering to RESTful conventions and ensuring a smooth user experience.

This structured approach ensures that the codebase remains clean, efficient, and easy to extend as new features are added.

   ```bash
   cd src
   cd backend
   node app.js OR nodemon app.js
### Running the Backend
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd src
   cd frontend_react
   npm start

## Code Examples

Code Example for API call for the emails

```javascript
// Example of calling the emailjs api
const reply = await fetch(`https://api.emailjs.com/api/v1.0/email/send`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.EMAILJS_PRIVATE_KEY_2}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
    console.log(reply);

    res.status(200).json({
      message: "Notification added successfully for admin.",
      notification,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error adding notification for admin:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to add notification for admin." });
  }
};
```
Code Example and how to make for adding item to cart

Here is the cart model
```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const CartItemSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  productId: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    required: true,
    ref: "Product",
  },
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true, // The name of the product
  },
  price: {
    type: Number,
    required: true, // Price per unit
  },
  quantity: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    default: 1, // Default quantity is 1
  },
  total: {
    type: Number, // Calculated as price * quantity
  },
  attributes: {
    type: Map, // Key-value pairs for product-specific attributes like size, color
    of: String,
    default: {},
  },
  picture: {
    type: String,
  },
});

CartItemSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  // Automatically calculate total
  this.total = this.price * this.quantity;
  next();
});

const CartSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  touristID: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    required: true,
    ref: "Tourist",
  },
  items: [CartItemSchema], // Array of cart items
  subtotal: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    default: 0,
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now, // Timestamp of when the cart was created
  },
  updatedAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now, // Timestamp of last cart update
  },
});

CartSchema.pre("save", function (next) {
  this.items.forEach((item) => {
    item.total = item.price * item.quantity;
  });

  // Calculate `subtotal` as the sum of all `total` fields
  this.subtotal = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.total, 0);

  next();
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Cart", CartSchema);
```
the  backend method
```javascript
const addItemToCart = async (req, res) => {
  const { touristID, productId, name, price, picture } = req.body;
  let { quantity, attributes } = req.body;
  if (!touristID || !productId || !name || !price) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Missing required fields" });
  }
  if (!quantity) {
    quantity = 1;
  }
  if (!attributes) {
    attributes = {};
  }
  try {
    // Find the user's cart
    let cart = await Cart.findOne({ touristID });

    if (!cart) {
      // If no cart exists, create a new one
      cart = new Cart({ touristID, items: [] });
    }

    // Check if the product with the same attributes is already in the cart
    const existingItem = cart.items.find((item) => {
      item.productId.toString() === productId &&
        JSON.stringify(item.attributes) === JSON.stringify(attributes);
    });

    if (existingItem) {
      // Increment the quantity if the same product with the same attributes exists
      existingItem.quantity += quantity;
    } else {
      // Add a new item with attributes
      cart.items.push({
        productId,
        name,
        price,
        quantity,
        attributes,
        picture,
      });
    }

    // Save the updated cart
    await cart.save();
    return res.status(200).json({ message: "Item added to cart successfully" });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: "Error adding item to cart" });
  }
};
```
here is calling the method in app.js
```javascript
app.post("/addItemToCart", upload.single("picture"), addItemToCart);
```
here how it is connected to the frontend
```javascript
 const handleAddToCart = async () => {
    setIsAdded(true);
    if (!isInStock()) return;
    try {
      const username = sessionStorage.getItem("username");
      const reply = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/getID/${username}`);
      if (!reply.ok) throw new Error("Failed to get tourist ID");

      const { userID } = await reply.json();
      const response = await axios.post(`http://localhost:8000/addItemToCart`, {
        touristID: userID,
        productId: product.productId,
        name: product.name,
        price: product.price,
        picture: product.image,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error adding to cart data:", error);
    }
  };
```

## Testing
- **Testing using Postman**: We take the url added in the app.js for ex. app.get("/viewBoughtProducts/:touristId", viewBoughtProducts); and add it postman to view
                             the desired outcome here is an example
